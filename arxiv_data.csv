iteration within machine learning workflow development, and report preliminary

engineering. A simple and efficient programming language could accelerate
applications of machine learning in various fields. Currently, the programming
languages most commonly used to develop machine learning algorithms include
Python, MATLAB, and C/C ++. However, none of these languages well balance both
efficiency and simplicity. The Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and
open-source programming language that was originally designed for
high-performance computing, which can well balance the efficiency and

the application of the Julia language in machine learning. It first surveys the

machine learning,"As machine learning becomes more and more available to the general public,
theoretical questions are turning into pressing practical issues. Possibly, one
of the most relevant concerns is the assessment of our confidence in trusting
machine learning predictions. In many real-world cases, it is of utmost
importance to estimate the capabilities of a machine learning algorithm to
generalize, i.e., to provide accurate predictions on unseen data, depending on
the characteristics of the target problem. In this work, we perform a
meta-analysis of 109 publicly-available classification data sets, modeling
machine learning generalization as a function of a variety of data set
characteristics, ranging from number of samples to intrinsic dimensionality,
from class-wise feature skewness to $F1$ evaluated on test samples falling
outside the convex hull of the training set. Experimental results demonstrate
the relevance of using the concept of the convex hull of the training data in
assessing machine learning generalization, by emphasizing the difference
between interpolated and extrapolated predictions. Besides several predictable
correlations, we observe unexpectedly weak associations between the
generalization ability of machine learning models and all metrics related to
dimensionality, thus challenging the common assumption that the \textit{curse
of dimensionality} might impair generalization in machine learning.",198,9,1425,8.91,19.0,18.2,18.59

practitioners' understanding of potential security challenges. In this work, we
close this substantial gap and contribute a qualitative study focusing on
developers' mental models of the machine learning pipeline and potentially
vulnerable components. Similar studies have helped in other security fields to
discover root causes or improve risk communication. Our study reveals two
\facets of practitioners' mental models of machine learning security. Firstly,
practitioners often confuse machine learning security with threats and defences
that are not directly related to machine learning. Secondly, in contrast to
most academic research, our participants perceive security of machine learning
as not solely related to individual models, but rather in the context of entire
workflows that consist of multiple components. Jointly with our additional
findings, these two facets provide a foundation to substantiate mental models
for machine learning security and have implications for the integration of
adversarial machine learning into corporate workflows, \new{decreasing

machine learning security.",171,8,1257,12.87,17.5,17.6,17.71

Fuzzing technology is widely used as a vulnerability discovery technology to
reduce damage in advance. However, traditional fuzzing techniques have many
challenges, such as how to mutate input seed files, how to increase code
coverage, and how to effectively bypass verification. Machine learning
technology has been introduced as a new method into fuzzing test to alleviate
these challenges. This paper reviews the research progress of using machine
learning technology for fuzzing test in recent years, analyzes how machine
learning improve the fuzz process and results, and sheds light on future work
in fuzzing. Firstly, this paper discusses the reasons why machine learning
techniques can be used for fuzzing scenarios and identifies six different
stages in which machine learning have been used. Then this paper systematically
study the machine learning based fuzzing models from selection of machine
learning algorithm, pre-processing methods, datasets, evaluation metrics, and

and covers all three main branches of machine learning: supervised,
unsupervised and reinforcement learning. While quantum improvements in
supervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning
has received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of

Interpretability is paramount in many high-stakes application of causal
inference. Current tools for nonparametric estimation of both average and
individualized treatment effects are black-boxes that do not allow for human
auditing of estimates. Our framework uses machine learning to learn an optimal
metric for matching units and estimating outcomes, thus achieving the
performance of machine learning black-boxes, while being interpretable. Our
general framework encompasses several published works as special cases. We
provide asymptotic inference theory for our proposed framework, enabling users
to construct approximate confidence intervals around estimates of both
individualized and average treatment effects. We show empirically that
instances of Matched Machine Learning perform on par with black-box machine
learning methods and better than existing matching methods for similar
problems. Finally, in our application we show how Matched Machine Learning can
